# Hypermax Front-End 2024

A grocery store website with 50,000 different products that can be compared, reviewed, filtered, and finally added to the shopping cart. Easy access to categories and subcategories that make it very easy to view their products. You can complete your purchase to have it delivered to your door. After each purchase, you can review the history of all your purchases.

This website is made using React.js, Vite and Typescript.
